# GoProxyRotator

A high-performance proxy rotator and concurrent HTTP requester written in Go. Designed for professional use in web scraping, load testing, red teaming, and distributed automation tasks.

## 🚀 Features

- 🔁 Automatically fetch and rotate proxies from multiple sources
- 🌐 Support for HTTP/SOCKS proxies
- 🔄 Smart retry logic and proxy cooldown on 429/NGINX rate limit
- ⚡ Up to 50 (or configurable) concurrent HTTP requests
- 📉 Real-time request statistics and error monitoring
- 🧠 Intelligent proxy recycling
- ⚙️ Configurable request targets and headers
- 🧪 Easily extensible for testing or research automation

## 🛠 Use Cases

### 1. Web Scraping at Scale (Data Engineering)
Use rotating proxies to scrape public data from websites while avoiding IP bans and rate limiting.

**Example:**  
- Scraping job postings from multiple career websites  
- Collecting real-time stock or product prices  
- Aggregating user reviews or public records

---

### 2. Load Testing / Stress Testing (DevOps/QA)
Simulate high volumes of user traffic from different IPs to test server resilience and rate-limiting rules.

**Example:**  
- Testing a new NGINX rate limiter configuration  
- Validating cloud API auto-scaling setups under load  
- Evaluating CDN performance from different regions

---

### 3. Red Teaming & Security Testing (Cybersecurity)
Mimic distributed attacker behavior by sending requests from multiple proxies to test WAFs, IP bans, and fraud detection.

**Example:**  
- Simulate botnet behavior for pentesting  
- Validate fraud-detection systems  
- Check exposure to DDoS-style request patterns

---

### 4. Geo-based Testing (QA / Localization Teams)
Access endpoints from various regions using rotating proxies to verify geolocation-based features or restrictions.

**Example:**  
- Test how a website behaves in different countries  
- Verify content delivery through geo-targeted CDNs  
- Check region-based feature gating

---

### 5. Academic / Journalistic Research
Maintain anonymity while performing automated data collection or media monitoring from restrictive regions.

**Example:**  
- Monitoring news or propaganda changes in certain countries  
- Researching how search engines show results based on IP origin  
- Tracking disinformation campaigns using bot behavior simulation
